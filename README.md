Introduction
This project is a simple HTML practice file created as part of my coursework. The goal is to become familiar with Git, GitHub, version control, and basic project structure. It serves as a sandbox for experimenting with commits, pushes, branches, and repository organization.
The project currently includes a basic webpage that displays a heading and a placeholder feature section.

Features
- Basic HTML structure (<!DOCTYPE html>, <head>, <body>)
- Page title: My First Site
- Simple “Hello, world!” heading
- Placeholder feature block: Super awesome feature1
- Linked stylesheet tag included for future styling

Prerequisites
Before using or modifying this project, you should have:
- A GitHub account
- Git installed on your computer
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)
- Basic understanding of HTML (optional but helpful)

Installation
- Clone the repository:
git clone <your-repo-url>
- Navigate into the project folder:
cd <your-project-folder>
- Open the project in your editor:
code .



Usage
- Open index.html in any web browser to view the page.
- Modify the HTML to practice editing, committing, and pushing changes.
- Add CSS to the linked stylesheet when you're ready to style the page.

Collaborators
This is a solo practice project, but created as part of coursework for Coding Temple.

Notes
This project is intentionally simple. Its purpose is to help me:
